# Quick Sort

This project implements the Quick Sort algorithm using C++. It allows you to create an array, add elements to it, perform sorting operations, and retrieve information about the array.

## Project Files

- `main.cpp`: The main entry point of the program. It reads instructions from input files and performs array operations using the `QS` class.
- `QS.h` and `QS.cpp`: The header and implementation files for the `QS` class, which handles array-related operations and implements the Quick Sort algorithm.
- `Makefile`: The Makefile for compiling the project.

## Usage

To compile and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the "Quick Sort" project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

### Using Makefile

4. Run the `make` command to compile the project:
make
5. Executre the compiled program:
./quicklab


## Instructions

The program reads instructions from input files and performs various operations on arrays. The supported instructions include:

- `createArray`: Create an array with a given capacity.
- `addToArray`: Add an element to the array.
- `getArray`: Get a string representation of the array.
- `getSize`: Get the size of the array.
- `sortAll`: Sort the array using the Quick Sort algorithm.
- `clear`: Clear the array.

Please refer to the source code (`main.cpp` and `QS.h`) for more details on the instructions and their usage.
